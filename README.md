<img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/jericjan/tab-purger" />

A [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium) extension that allows users to search and close tabs based on their title or URL.

## Installation
To install Tab Purger, follow these steps:

1. Get the latest release from https://github.com/jericjan/tab-purger/releases
2. Extract the zip to any folder (Can't provide a .crx file because it gets blocked by Chrome)
3. Open your list of extensions at chrome://extensions/
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you just extracted it to
5. Done!

## Usage
Once the extension is installed, you can click on it to search and close tabs in any Chromium browser.

It will first display all open tabs. To search for a tab, simply type a search query into the search bar. This will display all tabs with titles or URLs that match that query. You can click on a tab to switch to it on your browser.

To close a tab, click the close button next to the tab's title. If the tab you're closing is the currently active tab, you will be prompted to confirm that you want to close it. The currently active tab is colored green for easy visibility.

There is a big red button labelled "Purge". Clicking this will close all currently displayed tabs. Be careful not to purge *all* of your tabs.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the list of tabs and close tabs. Press "J" to move up, "K" to move down, and "Delete" to close the selected tab. The selected tab will be colored orange. To select a tab with mouse, you can press Ctrl + Left Click.
